# authd - WIP

Part \#2 of my Non-Interactive Auth0 Clients series - authd is a Daemon processing tool built in Crystal, interoperating with C.

Still not entirely certain of the functionality just yet, but that will be decided in the next week or so, when I start building it!

There will be a full, and detailed tutorial to accompany this repo, on the [Auth0 blog.](https://auth0.com/blog)
